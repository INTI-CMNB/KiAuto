### Changed
- Error level of src/pcbnew_run_drc to negative to be more coherent with the
run_erc command.
- Interpreter to Python 3.
- Renamed the main scripts so they don't include .py in the name.
- Renamed the "util" package to "kicad_auto" (less generic).
- Moved the eeschema/export_bom.py functionality to the bom_xml command of
src/eeschema_do.
- eeschema/schematic.py -> src/eeschema_do.py (more descriptive name).
- Now we keep only the last recorded video.
- Added creation of a suitable eeschema config, instead of editing the current.
- Made schematic and output_dir position args (always used).
- Removed --screencast_dir in favor of --record (+ size).
- _pcbnew/print_layers.py to src/pcbnew_print_layers.
- Renamed _pcbnew/run_drc.py to src/pcbnew_run_drc.
- Made some debug/info message classification to make it cleaner.
- Supressed the recordmydesktop output.
- Now the screencast files are named according to the recorded task.
- Suppressed the pcbnew stderr (noissy).
- Disabled long waits to test for old errors.
- Adapted to KiCad 5.1.x.
- Saves the current pcbnew/eeschema config and creates one usable.
The originals are restored.

### Removed
- Custom configs. Now they are generated on-the-fly.
- _pcbnew/generate_svg.py, its functionality can be achieved using pcbnew_print_layers.
- _pcbnew/generate_gerber.py, kiplot project has a better solution.

### Fixed
- Simplified the copy/paste mechanism used for run_erc. The old one could fail.
- src/pcbnew* always recorded the session.
- Adjusted the pcbnew first time-out, for some reason I'm getting huge delays.
- A test (and wait) for the Xvfb, sometimes is slow and xclip runs before it.
- clipboard_store rewrite, the old version ignored any errors
- Made stronger the eeschema config parser.
- Language set as english + UTF-8 (to run outside docker).
